# HTML Portfolio
A basic page of who I am. 

# Email Signatures
I use this page to host email links, images, and other things I need across the web. 

```
git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages
```

This will push the `src` folder up to GitHub on the `gh-pages` branch. After that, you should be able to open up `http://username.github.io/HTMLPortfolioProject`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
